    #
    this is a somewhat advanced and generic Eclipse data-file reader.
    it uses the (available) Eclipse keywords for splitting the data-file into
    chunks of data. then each chunk is splitted into (possibly) multiple lines
    by the DELIM separator.  it also handles default values by giving you a 1*
    (if raw data is asked for) or a NaN (if numeric value is asked for)
    #
    note1: it is important to realize that Eclipse input does not really care
           too much about the \\n (newline), even if humans will typically
           organize the data file according to this. since Eclipse does not
           like long input lines, it allows a record to be broken into several
           lines. it expects, however, that a new record starts on a new line
           (so we cannot just split the entire file by the DELIM).
           see also note5 below.
    note2: it picks up keywords from the HTML-directory for manual. if there
           is a keyword in the DATA-file that is not found in the list of
           existing keywords, this code will probably fail big time. you are
           allowed to add any keyword by using the xtra_kws parameter found
           in the constructor.
    note3 : it does not follow INCLUDE-files, so the keyword you are looking
            for must be found in the provided file.
    note4: one technicality which makes it more difficult to handle the
           keywords generically, is that some of them, like COMPDAT, can
           have multiple wells inside one instance of the keyword,
           while others, like WELSEGS only allows one well per keyword (which
           implies multiple keywords). this is handled internally by adding a
           counter to each keyword, indicating how many times it has
           been found (like COMPDAT-1, WELSEGS-1, WELSEGS-2 ...)
    note5: another problem is that you are allowed to put several records in
           one line (separated by DELIM) and also that you are allowed to
           write comments after the DELIM. use remove_after_delim if you have
           one line per record and comments after DELIM.
           update 2020-09-07: i dont think this is correct - you cannot have
           several records in one line. see note1 above.
    note6: for the SPECIAL_KWS (like EQUALS) it assumes the format is like
           this (with the ending '/' on a separate line):
       EQUALS
        PERMX 1000 1 11 1 19 1 1 /
        PORO  0.3  /
