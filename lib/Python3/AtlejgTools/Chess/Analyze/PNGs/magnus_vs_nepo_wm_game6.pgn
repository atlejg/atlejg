{At the end of game five, I predicted that we would see a more eventful game
six, as Magnus would probably double dip for the first time  and play either 1.
e4 or 1.d4 with a pretty good idea of what he would be  facing. Given Nepo's
repertoire, I was not too surprised to see Magnus aim for some kind of Catalan.
While the opening and early middlegame certainly looked dull as Magnus wasn't
able to apply much pressure, the game did  liven up at some point, and my
prediction came true as we finally saw a  full point scored.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3
d5 3. g3 e6 4. Bg2 Be7 5. O-O O-O 6. b3 {This is an interesting move order for
White. He clearly is aiming to  play c4 at a moment when he is ready to take
back with the pawn.} 6... c5 7. dxc5 (7. c4 {This would lead to a more typical
position, which I have    actually played a bunch of times on the white side in
rapid games. It    is a little tricky, but generally, I think mostly harmless
against a    prepared opponent in classical chess. Still, I am somehow not
impressed with what Magnus played either.}) 7... Bxc5 8. c4 dxc4 9. Qc2 {Now,
White will win back the lost c4-pawn  without allowing his structure to become
compromised. Then, he can hope to end up a little better if Black can't develop
his queenside or find a way  to get the c8-bishop into the game. But, I think
this is too optimistic.  In the time it takes White to grab the pawn back, Black
will complete his  development.} 9... Qe7 10. Nbd2!? {[%c_effect
d2;square;d2;type;Interesting;persistent;true] Magnus has showed a remarkable 
willingness to sacrifice pawns this match. I like this decision! The knight
taking back on c4 will look a lot more sensible than the queen.} 10... Nc6!
{[%c_effect c6;square;c6;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] I like this decision.
Black doesn't bother going pawn  grabbing and instead makes sure to complete his
development before he  faces any issues on the long diagonal.} (10... cxb3 {The
machine is not scared of grabbing the pawn, but    after something like} 11.
Nxb3 Bd6 12. Nfd4 {White has clear compensation as now Black was unable to
develop his queenside before    the pressure on the long diagonal become too
problematic. I don't see    a great way to get the bishop on c8 into the game.
The machine calls    it equal, but in human terms, White certainly seems more
comfortable, and I find it unsurprising that Nepo did not go for it.}) 11. Nxc4
{Now, Bd7 leaves the bishop on a still less than impressive  square, though even
there I imagine White can't hope for too much. Black  has two ways to solve his
problem piece, and Nepo chose the more direct one.} 11... b5! {[%c_effect
b5;square;b5;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] This looks like a scary move as
Black seems like he  is asking for trouble on the long diagonal, but the tempo
he wins by hitting the c4-knight gives him enough time to get his bishop to b7.
Structurally, White is surely not better. His only edge was hoping that  the
g2-bishop would be active, and the c8-bishop passive. This will no  longer be
the case, and we end up in a dry, symmetrical position where  Black has no major
issues.} (11... Bd7) (11... e5!? {[%c_effect
e5;square;e5;type;Interesting;persistent;true] This was fine too. Black's bishop
will find a nice    square on g4, or even f5 if he pushes e5-e4 first.}) 12.
Nce5 {Now, Black should be careful. He clearly wants to get the bishop to b7,
but he needs to do it the right way.} (12. Nfe5? {[%c_effect
e5;square;e5;type;Mistake;persistent;true] This might look tempting, but it only
creates problems    for White. After} 12... Nd4! {[%c_effect
d4;square;d4;type;GreatFind;persistent;true]} 13. Qd1 Bb7! {[%c_effect
b7;square;b7;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] Black is taking over    the
initiative.}) 12... Nb4! {[%c_effect
b4;square;b4;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] Black clears the knight off of the
hanging square with a  gain of tempo and is ready for Bc8-b7 next, equalizing.}
(12... Bb7? {[%c_effect b7;square;b7;type;Mistake;persistent;true] This tempting
move would lose material after} 13. Nxc6 Bxc6 14. b4! {[%c_effect
b4;square;b4;type;GreatFind;persistent;true]} 14... Bxf3 15. Bxf3 {when Black
has hanging pieces on    both a8 and c5.}) 13. Qb2 Bb7 14. a3 Nc6! {[%c_effect
c6;square;c6;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] Since the queen is no longer on c2,
this move  is safe as there is no b3-b4 thrust to skewer the bishops on the
c-file. The position looks very equal, though soon enough some imbalance was 
found.} 15. Nd3 Bb6 16. Bg5 Rfd8 17. Bxf6 gxf6!? {[%c_effect
f6;square;f6;type;Interesting;persistent;true] This is not a bad move, but its a
bit surprising to me. Given that the pawn structure will become  crippled either
way, why would we keep queens on? I suppose Black's king  is not feeling any
particular pressure.} (17... Qxf6 {This would have been my choice. I might even
prefer    Black.}) 18. Rac1 Nd4 (18... e5 {The machine flashed this move
briefly, but it seems    super inhuman to me. Black is just begging for an
invasion on f5.} 19. Nh4 Nd4 20. e3 Bxg2 21. Kxg2 Qb7+ 22. Kg1 Ne6 {Apparently,
Black is a   little better here with Ne6-g5 coming next. It looks super scary
for a   human though. Some Qb2-e2 and Nh4-f5 does not look like fun.}) 19. Nxd4
Bxd4 20. Qa2 Bxg2 21. Kxg2 Qb7+ 22. Kg1 Qe4 23. Qc2 a5 24. Rfd1 Kg7 25. Rd2
{This was the first position I saw of the game, as inflight WiFi had not been
working to that point. I just assumed it would end in a  draw pretty promptly,
but I did not expect Nepo to immediately change the  character of the game.}
25... Rac8!? {[%c_effect c8;square;c8;type;Interesting;persistent;true] This is
surely not a bad move, and it does liven things up, but it strikes me as very
risky. The computer insists that the position remains equal, but it looks much
more double  edged after the queen is traded for the two rooks. Black's position
can  become risky as his kingside pawns being split means that neither f7 nor 
h7 can be defended by another pawn. This being the case, having a greater 
number of pieces can be a really big deal, and two rooks have some  potential to
overpower the queen. Black is definitely still fine, but he  should be looking
for direct active counterplay on the queenside. Still, given how the game played
out, I suspect Nepo may have found himself  regretting this decision, even if it
was not the one that objectively  landed him in a bad position.} (25... f5 {Some
simple move like this one, making room for the bishop on f6 and putting more
pawns on light squares, was what I was expecting. It looks very equal and very
drawn.}) 26. Qxc8 Rxc8 27. Rxc8 Qd5 28. b4 a4 29. e3 Be5?! {[%c_effect
e5;square;e5;type;Inaccuracy;persistent;true] The machine still  claims the
position is equal, but I believe this was a big step in the  wrong direction.
Black could have immediately gone for a line where White  needs to find two only
moves before a draw is agreed, and instead he sort  of lazily brings the bishop
back as if his position is not under any pressure and he has all the time in the
world.} (29... Bb2 {This might have been a little more challenging, forcing
White to find a couple good moves, but it can't be too tough.} 30. Rc5!
{[%c_effect c5;square;c5;type;GreatFind;persistent;true]} 30... Qd6 31. Rxb2
Qxd3 {Now, White's position actually looks really    dangerous since a3 is
falling. He needs to find one only move, but    then he is fine.} 32. Rbc2!
{[%c_effect c2;square;c2;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] Not too difficult.
White moves his rook   away so it will not be hanging when a3 is taken, and now
he is ready    to meet Qxa3 with Rxb5. It should be quite drawish. Still, Magnus
was    low enough on time that there was some non-zero chance he would not   
find his way with a couple only moves. But... non-zero, but not high either.})
30. h4 h5? {[%c_effect h5;square;h5;type;Mistake;persistent;true] Now White has
real weaknesses to play against. The h5-pawn  can certainly become a target, and
once more Black missed his chance to  directly equalize.} (30... Bb2 {This was
still fine, but it is basically an admission    that Be5 was a bad decision.
This is not an easy thing for a human to    do, especially if he still thinks
the position is fine.}) 31. Kh2 {Sesse claims Black is still fine here. In human
terms, I think he has a lot of problems to solve. He is missing counterplay and
will have to be very wary of the rooks suddenly invading the position. My
onboard WiFi  cut out here as well, and I knew it would be some time before we
were over a land mass again. At this moment, despite being short on time, I
thought  Magnus would have a really good position by the time I got to see it 
again.} 31... Bb2? {[%c_effect b2;square;b2;type;Mistake;persistent;true] Now it
is too late for this. White should be  winning, but with the clock ticking down,
Magnus did not find the way.} 32. Rc5 Qd6 33. Rd1? {[%c_effect
d1;square;d1;type;Mistake;persistent;true] This let a big chance slip.} (33.
Rcc2! {[%c_effect c2;square;c2;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] [ Carlsen: \"That
was not on my radar. As a matter of fact, when I went for this Rd1 I just missed
...Qd7. I thought I would be in time to go Rb4 and eliminate those pawns, so
that was more an oversight than anything else.\"]

} 33... Bxa3 34. Nf4 $1
{[%c_effect f4;square;f4;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] White has a decisive
attack, as his rooks will soon penetrate to the 7th or 8th rank, and h5 is a
goner. I suspect Magnus saw this, but missed that after} 34... Qe7 35. Rc8 $1
{[%c_effect c8;square;c8;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] Would win. In fact,
every other move loses $1}) 33... Bxa3 34. Rxb5 Qd7 35. Rc5 e5 (35... Bxb4 {I'm
not sure why Nepo did not play this move, though I   am not as optimistic as the
machine about his winning chances.}) 36. Rc2 Qd5 $6 {[%c_effect
d5;square;d5;type;Inaccuracy;persistent;true]} (36... Bxb4 $1 {[%c_effect
b4;square;b4;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] Again, this looked tempting.}) 37.
Rdd2 $1 {[%c_effect d2;square;d2;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] Now White has
everything under control, and the a3-bishop is  in some trouble.} 37... Qb3 38.
Ra2 e4 $2 {[%c_effect e4;square;e4;type;Mistake;persistent;true] With time control
rapidly  approaching, both sides missed an important idea.} (38... f5 {So says
the machine, and apparently Black is fine. This    is super tough for a human to
play, particularly with no time.}) 39. Nc5 Qxb4 {Now, Magnus had a move clear
winner. It is super bad luck  for him that the chance happened to present itself
on move 40 rather than  41 $1} 40. Nxe4 $2 {[%c_effect
e4;square;e4;type;Mistake;persistent;true]} (40. Rdc2 $1 {[%c_effect
c2;square;c2;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] This should win routinely. Black's
queen and bishop are   both completely stuck, and White is ready for Nxa4 next.
After    something like} 40... f5 41. Nxa4 Qxa4 42. Rc3 $18 {White should be   
technically winning. He will get his rooks to the seventh rank and    take on
f7. This is exactly the kind of position I was talking about earlier where
Black's weak pawns means simply having a greater number    of total pieces is a
huge advantage, and the two rooks should easily    beat the queen.}) 40... Qb3
{Time control is reached, and Black is more or less okay.} 41. Rac2 Bf8 42. Nc5
Qb5 43. Nd3 a3 {Black's a-pawn is annoying enough though it is really hard for
White to break through.} 44. Nf4 Qa5 45. Ra2 Bb4 46. Rd3 Kh6 47. Rd1 Qa4 48.
Rda1 {Magnus is trying to reorganize his pieces  to target the a3-pawn, but it
will be really hard to get the knight to  join as well.} 48... Bd6 49. Kg1 Qb3
50. Ne2 Qd3 51. Nd4 Kh7 {Case in  point, it looks like Nc2 should pick up a3 and
promptly win the game, but  things are not so simple.} 52. Kh2 (52. Nc2 Qb3 $1
{[%c_effect b3;square;b3;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] White struggles to take
on a3 thanks to Bd6-e5    hanging over his head. I don't see a great plan for
him.} 53. Nxa3 $2 {[%c_effect a3;square;a3;type;Mistake;persistent;true]} 53...
Be5 $1 {[%c_effect e5;square;e5;type;GreatFind;persistent;true]}) 52... Qe4 $6
{[%c_effect e4;square;e4;type;Inaccuracy;persistent;true] This strikes me as a
bit careless. Now, Magnus took the  chance to change the position and get rid of
the a-pawn, but it became a  bit too simplified to seriously hope to play for a
win against good  defense.} 53. Rxa3 Qxh4+ $1 {[%c_effect
h4;square;h4;type;GreatFind;persistent;true]} (53... Bxa3 $2 {[%c_effect
a3;square;a3;type;Mistake;persistent;true]} 54. Rxa3 {White should be totally
winning here    despite the relative material balance. The queen's main strength
is    being able to attack multiple things at once, and here, Black has   
nothing to attack. White will maneuvre Ra3-a5-f5-f4, then knight    around to e4
to force f6-f5, then knight comes to d4, and Black collapses.}) 54. Kg1 Qe4 55.
Ra4 Be5 $1 {[%c_effect e5;square;e5;type;GreatFind;persistent;true]} 56. Ne2 Qc2
57. R1a2 Qb3 {The bishop on e5 is  incredibly well placed. White somehow does
not quite have the coordination he needs to finish the game off.} 58. Kg2 Qd5+
59. f3 {The machine hates  this move, but I don't see another great way to make
progress.} 59... Qd1 60. f4 Bc7 {The pawn being forced off of f2 really weakens
White's  pawn chain, and his king's cover. It will be very hard for him to do
something like double on the seventh and take on f7 as long as his  kingside
needs defenders.} 61. Kf2 Bb6 $1 {[%c_effect
b6;square;b6;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] Targeting the weak e3-pawn.} 62.
Ra1 Qb3 63. Re4 {White has coordinated his position about as well as  possible,
but it will still be a nightmare to break through. This was the  first position
I saw once my internet came back, and I was unsurprised  that there were some
missed chances along the way. The rook on e4 holds  everything together but is
also tethered to the defense of the e3-pawn.  The knight on e2 is not wildly
mobile either. Still, Magnus is head and  shoulders above every player in
history at grinding out positions like  this one, and it showed.} 63... Kg7 64.
Re8 f5 65. Raa8 {Even with the  rooks invading like this, what is White's next
move $2} 65... Qb4 66. Rac8 Ba5 67. Rc1 Bb6 68. Re5 Qb3 69. Re8 Qd5 70. Rcc8
{White is not making any progress on the board, but progress on the clock is
more important. The position is surely a draw objectively, but Black will have
to defend it  for 50 moves, and if anything ever drops, he will surely lose.
White's  best chance is to pressure Black on the clock, and here Nepo was down
to 5 minutes.} 70... Qh1 (70... Qb3 {This was also fine.}) 71. Rc1 Qd5 72. Rb1
Ba7 $2 {[%c_effect a7;square;a7;type;Mistake;persistent;true] Case in point. This
is a bad move, and the  product of not having much time.} (72... Bd8 {Black
keeps all unwanted guests off of the 7th rank and   is ready for h4 next.}) 73.

still thinks this is a draw, but a human would    almost certainly lose with
Black.}) (77. Re7) 77... Bb6 78. Rab5 Ba7 79. Rxf5 $1 {[%c_effect

Ra6+ Kf7 88. Nf3 $1 {[%c_effect f3;square;f3;type;GreatFind;persistent;true]
White's king  is totally safe for the moment. The machine still claims Black is
making a draw here, but for a human with no time... this feels impossible. There
 are no direct perpetuals, Black will have to sit and defend perfectly for  50
moves until a pawn moves, then for another 50 moves... even with time  on the
clock, I would expect a human to crack. Without it, no chance.} 88... Qb1 89.

seen enough, and finally, the  impasse was broken $1 Magnus won in his trademark
style, not taking a ton of risks, but taking his chance to imbalance the game
when it came, and then gradually grinding out a win from what was a defensible
but unpleasant  position for Black. I like that it came in phases, and that one
phase was, \"This position is technically still a draw, but there is no chance a
human will hold it.\" Surely Nepo could have defended better before allowing
Rxf5 and Rxf7 to transform the position, but after that, I doubt there was much
he could do. Now that a point is on the scoreboard, we could see a very 
different looking match in the games to come $1} 1-0
